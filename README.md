# SpotifywebAPI-Vue3App

To develop this Vue application, I used Spotify Web API (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api) to catch and manage data from Spotify. For state management I used
Pinia, for style CSS with media query for responsive.

Once connected to their Spotify account, users gain access to a range of features. They can explore music by category, search for their favorite artists, and listen to their playlists. Additionally, users have the option to create their own playlists, where they can add their favorite tracks.
